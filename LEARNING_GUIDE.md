# Configuration Management Project Learning Guide

Use this guide to understand the complete implementation of the roadmap.sh Configuration Management project using Ansible. This prompt can be given to any LLM (Language Learning Model) to learn about the project in detail.

## Project Overview Prompt

```markdown
I completed the Configuration Management project from roadmap.sh using Ansible. Please help me understand the complete implementation in detail. Here's what we built:

1. Infrastructure Setup:
- Created 2 EC2 instances:
  * Control Node: Amazon Linux 2023 (t2.micro)
  * Target Node: Ubuntu (t2.micro)
- Set up SSH keys:
  * ~/.ssh/my_first_key for Control Node
  * ~/.ssh/roadmapsh-ansible-key.pem for Target Node
- Configured domain (ansible.nikhilmishra.live) with DNS pointing to Target Node
- Configured AWS security groups for ports 22, 80, and 443

2. Project Structure:
```bash
configuration-management/
├── inventory.ini           # Server definitions
├── setup.yml              # Main playbook
├── requirements.txt       # Python dependencies
├── copy_to_control.sh     # File transfer script
├── setup_control_node.sh  # Control node setup
└── roles/
    ├── base/             # System setup
    │   ├── tasks/
    │   └── handlers/
    ├── nginx/            # Web server
    │   ├── tasks/

    │   └── defaults/
    └── ssh/              # SSH security
        ├── tasks/
        └── handlers/
```

3. Detailed Implementation:

a) Base Role:

  * Port 443 (HTTPS)
- fail2ban for brute force protection
- SSL/TLS encryption
- Security headers:
  * X-Frame-Options: SAMEORIGIN
  * X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block
  * X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff
  * Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS)
- Regular security updates
- Principle of least privilege
- Defense in depth strategy

5. Automation Scripts:
a) setup_control_node.sh:
- System updates
- Python and pip installation
- Ansible installation
- AWS dependencies (boto3)
- SSH configuration
- Environment setup
- Path configuration
- Error handling

b) copy_to_control.sh:
- Project files transfer
- SSH keys copying
- Permission setting
- Validation checks
- Error handling
- User feedback

6. Configuration Files:
a) inventory.ini:
- Server definitions
- SSH key paths
- Connection settings
- Python interpreter specification
- Group variables

b) setup.yml:
- Role execution order
- Privilege escalation
- Fact gathering
- Pre-tasks for connectivity
- Error handling
- Tags for selective execution
